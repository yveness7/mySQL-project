Hi reader! In this project called ‘You’ve Been Warned’, analysed data retrieved from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 

The objective of this preliminary analysis is to getter a better understanding on the most threatened groups of species on our planet in terms of numbers based on the available data and by choosing two geographic areas of interest to us, Europe and South & South Eastern Asia, to find out which of the two areas has more threatened species, as well as in which country we could potential draft a conservation plan. 

The data that was used for out analysis is publicly accessible on this link https://www.iucnredlist.org/statistics in the form of CSV. 

The data was already clean no with null or Nan values present, so we processed in identifying common 

The objective for our effort  is to analyse the data with the use of MySQL and Python, and then visualise the results on Tableau. 

An important aspect of our analysis that is worth being mentioned is that during our analysis, we used 5 different datasets: the global distribution of threatened species, the distribution of threatened species in Europe by major group by country,  the distribution of threatened species in South & South East Asia by major group by country, the threatened animal species in Europe and the ones in South East Asia. 


Thanks!
