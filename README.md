Welcome to ‘You’ve Been Warned!’. Our project has as it's main goal to analyze data retrieved from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and retreive insites based on clearly defined hypothesis. 

The objective of this preliminary analysis is to get a better understanding on the most threatened groups of species on our planet in terms of numbers based on the available data and by choosing two geographic areas of interest to us, Europe and South & South Eastern Asia, to find out which of the two areas has more threatened species, as well as in which country we could potential draft a conservation plan. 

The data that was used for out analysis is publicly accessible on this link https://www.iucnredlist.org/statistics in the form of CSVs.

The data was already clean no with null or Nan values present. 

The objective for our effort is to analyse the data with the use of MySQL, Python and Pandas,and then visualise the results with Matplotlib and Tableau.

An important aspect of our analysis that is worth mentioning is that during our analysis, we used 5 different datasets: the global distribution of threatened species, the distribution of threatened species in Europe by major group by country,  the distribution of threatened species in South & South East Asia by major group by country, the threatened animal species in Europe and the ones in South East Asia.
